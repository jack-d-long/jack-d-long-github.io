# Lab

## Task 1
I connected the Artemis successfully, but found no way to fix the macOS Sequoia connection issue.

<br>

## Task 2

In File->Examples->01.Basics, I ran Blink. The code successfully uploaded and the Artemis blinked.

## Task 4

In File->Examples->Apollo3, I ran Example2_analogRead to test my temperature sensor. I blew hot air over the board and the temp sensor successfully displayed a temperature increase.

## Task 5

In File->Examples->PDM, I ran Example1_MicrophoneOutput to test my microphone. I attempted to maintain one note in my voice and the loudest frquency output was pretty consistent, sometimes outputting resonant frequencies of my voice.
