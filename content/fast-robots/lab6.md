## Collaborations

I worked with [Lucca Correia](https://correial.github.io/) and [Trevor Dales](https://trevordales.github.io/) extensively, and referenced [Daria's](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/dak267/dak267.github.io/#contact) and [Mavis'](https://mavisfu.github.io/lab3.html) site for wiring and local test code snippets.
