# Previous: [Lab 2](/fast-robots/lab2)

# Prelab
Note the I2C sensor address
Briefly discuss the approach to using 2 ToF sensors
Briefly discuss placement of sensors on robot and scenarios where you will miss obstacles
Sketch of wiring diagram (with brief explanation if you want)
# Lab Tasks
Picture of your ToF sensor connected to your QWIIC breakout board
Screenshot of Artemis scanning for I2C device (and discussion on I2C address)
Discussion and pictures of sensor data with chosen mode
2 ToF sensors: Discussion and screenshot of sensors working in parallel
Tof sensor speed: Discussion on speed and limiting factor; include code snippet of how you do this
Time v Distance: Include graph of data sent over bluetooth (2 sensors)
Time v Angle: Include graph of data sent over bluetooth
(5000) Discussion on infrared transmission based sensors
(5000) Sensitivity of sensors to colors and textures



## Collaborations
I worked with [Lucca Correia](https://correial.github.io/) and [Trevor Dales](https://trevordales.github.io/) extensively, and referenced [Daria's site](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/dak267/dak267.github.io/#contact) to troubleshoot FFT code. 
I used ChatGPT to generate a faster Python notification handler with less dictionary operations, for plotting syntax, and for more information on FFT implementation.
